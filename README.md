# We are AKMedia.

AKMedia (est. 2025) is a media company specializing mainly in music that focues on innovation in multimedia and sound design, paving a new space for creators to collaborate and feel comfortable presenting themselves online to listeners and their peers.

### History

AKMedia began with the launch of its first project, aeradio, in June 2025. The company’s founders, Jude and Aethy, initially connected while attempting to form a music group. Although the group itself did not materialize, their collaboration evolved into something new. Aethy began developing the concept for aeradio and brought Jude in to test and refine the idea. What started as a simple but compelling concept, an online platform that shuffled and showcased music for discovery, and quickly resonated with a growing community of artists and listeners.

aeradio officially launched in June 2025 and gained momentum at an unexpected pace. The platform attracted a strong roster of artists and received sponsorships and donations from its community. In August 2025, independent Florida-based label SHIFT+CTRL Music began sponsoring the project on a monthly basis, marking a significant milestone in its early growth.

That same month, Jude and Aethy formalized their collaboration by founding AKMedia, officially bringing aeradio under the company’s umbrella. The success and attention surrounding the platform encouraged the founders to expand their ambitions beyond a single project.

In late August 2025, aeradio entered an indefinite hiatus due to technical difficulties and has remained offline since. Despite this setback, AKMedia continued developing new concepts and experimenting with future-facing ideas, including a poetry-focused social platform and a hybrid music service concept blending elements of Spotify and Bandcamp. While these projects have not yet been publicly released, they remain part of the company’s broader creative exploration.

As of 2026, AKMedia remains active and forward-looking. The company continues to quietly develop aeradio and is evaluating a potential relaunch. While no official return has been confirmed, the project remains an important part of AKMedia’s long-term vision.
